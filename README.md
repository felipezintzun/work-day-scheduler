# Work Day Scheduler

Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

My app allows the user to:

- Add & delete notes for the hours of 9 AM - 5 PM 
- The notes added will stay even if page is refreshed - saved to local storage
- Current time is displayed at the top using Moment.js
- Time slots that have passed will appear in a dark gray color
- Time slots that are current will appear in a white
- Time slots in the futre will appear light gray
